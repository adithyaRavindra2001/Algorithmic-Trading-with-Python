This project takes the input from the generator.py file which generates random float values based on eulers discretization of brownian motion:

main.py asks for the capital to be invested and based on the strategy and the incoming values, it goes long or stays neutral.
The generator.py file must be executed in another terminal simultaneuously for this to be executed.



I hope you learnt something new today.Cheers :)
