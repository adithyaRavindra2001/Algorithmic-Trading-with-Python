# Algorithmic-Trading-with-Python
This repository contains a few basic projects based on algorithmic trading with python.

1)In the first project i have accessed the prices of every stock in S&P500 and analysed it based on its market cap.

2)The second project demonstrates an investing strategy known as momentum based investing.This strategy involves analysing the previous year to date,last 6 months, 3 months , 1 month returns and chooses the top 50 stocks to invest in.

3)The third project demonstrates an investing strategy known as value based investing. This strategy involves analysing multiple valuation metrics like Price-to-Earnings Ratio, Price-to-Book Ratio,Price-to-Sales Ratio,EV/EBITDA ,EV/GP.

4)The fourth project visulaizes the 30 and 200 day moving average strategy for BTC. In this technique the token is bought when the 30 day moving average rises above the 200 day moving average cost and shorted when it goes below it. This is a very simple strategy and we can observe that the profit margins are also quite low when the time period is considered. (3000%+ as seen from this project)
